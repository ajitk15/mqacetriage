# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A single Model Context Protocol (MCP) server (`mqacemcpserver`) that exposes
read-only diagnostic tools for **IBM MQ** and **IBM App Connect Enterprise (ACE)**
— plus read-only **Splunk** log search (`splunk_*`) for historical triage /
root-cause — under one endpoint. The hosting orchestrator's LLM picks the right
tool from the unified tool list — there is no in-server router. Production
posture: the central team consumes one SSE endpoint; everything else (logging,
sanitised errors, allow-list, read-only enforcement) is in-process.

The chatbot's ReAct agent can CHAIN a `splunk_*` log search with a live
`mq_*`/`ace_*` inspection to confirm a root cause (the TRIAGE PROTOCOL in the
system prompts) — e.g. read MQRC 2016 from the logs, then verify `GET(DISABLED)`
on the live queue. The MCP server tools themselves remain single, stateless calls.

## Development commands

The main build lives in `mqacemcpserver/`. Its dev `.venv` stays at the **repo
root** (shared), but its code, tests, and `requirements.txt` live in the build
folder. Paths in the architecture section below are relative to `mqacemcpserver/`.

```powershell
# venv + deps (Windows) — venv at repo root, requirements in the build folder
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r mqacemcpserver\requirements.txt

# Run (stdio, default) — from repo root; cwd stays root so .env/resources resolve
.venv\Scripts\python.exe mqacemcpserver\mqacemcpserver.py

# Run (SSE — endpoint at http://MCP_HOST:MCP_PORT/sse, healthz at /healthz)
$env:MCP_TRANSPORT = "sse"
.venv\Scripts\python.exe mqacemcpserver\mqacemcpserver.py

# Smoke check that all tools register (run from inside the build folder)
cd mqacemcpserver
..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -c "import mqacemcpserver as m; print(sorted(m.mcp._tool_manager._tools.keys()))"

# Tests — run from INSIDE mqacemcpserver/. Both mqacemcpserver/ and
# mqacemcpserver-single/ ship a top-level `server` package, so running pytest
# from the repo root collides on the import name — run each suite in its folder.
cd mqacemcpserver
..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install pytest pytest-asyncio   # one-time
..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q                           # full suite
..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/test_mq_queue_depth.py -q  # single file
..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -k "redacts" -q              # by name
```

`mqacemcpserver/tests/conftest.py` redirects `LOG_DIR` to a temp directory
**before** `server.config` is imported. Do not move that fixture out of
`conftest.py`, and do not import from `server.*` at the top of `conftest.py`
itself — the env vars must be set first.

## Big-picture architecture

### Tool routing without a dispatcher
Every MQ tool's docstring opens with `IBM MQ:`, every ACE tool's with `IBM ACE:`,
the certificate tool's with `Certificate:`, and every Splunk log-search tool's
with `Splunk:`.
Tool **names** are also disambiguated (`dspmq`, `runmqsc`, `list_ace_nodes`,
`get_cert_details`, `splunk_mq_errors`, …).
The orchestrator's LLM uses these to route — preserve both conventions whenever
adding or renaming a tool, otherwise routing degrades silently.

### Decorator stack on every MCP tool
```python
@mcp.tool()       # outer — registers with FastMCP
@logged_tool      # inner — emits one JSONL line per call to logs/queries-*.jsonl
async def my_tool(...): ...
```
Order matters. FastMCP introspects `inspect.signature` which follows
`functools.wraps`'s `__wrapped__` set by `@logged_tool`. Reversing the order
breaks tool registration.

### Safety is enforced in three places, do not bypass any of them
1. **Hostname allow-list** (`server/safety.py:is_hostname_allowed`) — every outbound
   call resolves a target hostname, then checks it against
   `MQ_ALLOWED_HOSTNAME_PREFIXES`, `ACE_ALLOWED_HOSTNAME_PREFIXES`, or
   `SPLUNK_ALLOWED_HOSTNAME_PREFIXES`. There are **three separate allow-lists**
   (MQ, ACE, and Splunk infra typically live on different host families). Wrappers in
   `mq_helpers.py`, `ace_helpers.py`, and `splunk_helpers.py` (each a `hostname_allowed`)
   call into the shared primitive with the right list.
2. **Read-only MQSC** (`server/safety.py:is_modification_command`) — `runmqsc` and
   `run_mqsc_for_object` block ALTER/DEFINE/DELETE/CLEAR/MOVE/SET/RESET/START/STOP/
   PURGE/REFRESH/RESOLVE/ARCHIVE/BACKUP and return `MODIFY_BLOCKED_MSG` instead.
   **Read-only SPL** (`server/safety.py:is_unsafe_spl`) is the Splunk analogue —
   `run_spl` blocks `delete`/`outputlookup`/`collect`/`sendemail`/`script`/`dump`/…
   and returns `SPL_BLOCKED_MSG` before any call.
3. **Allow-list precedes every HTTP call**, including the unknown-QM path in
   `runmqsc`. The previous version had a silent fall-through (used the QM name as
   a hostname when the manifest didn't list it) — that's a security bug. The
   current code rejects unknown QMs with no explicit hostname; do not reintroduce
   the fallback.

### Error sanitisation contract
**No tool ever returns raw exception text or upstream response bodies.** Both
`server/mq_helpers.py:friendly_error` and `server/ace_helpers.py:fetch_ace` route
all caught exceptions through `server/errors.py:safe_error_message`, which:
1. Reads `request_id` from `server.query_log._current_query` (set by `@logged_tool`).
2. Writes the full traceback to `logs/app-YYYY-MM-DD.log` via `logger.exception`.
3. Returns `f"⚠️ {curated_hint} (ref {request_id})"` to the user.

When adding a new code path that catches an exception, route it through
`safe_error_message` — never `str(err)` or `err.response.text` to the user.

### Observability is via two ContextVars
- `_current_query` (`server/query_log.py`) — set by `@logged_tool`, holds the
  in-flight record. Helpers stamp endpoints onto it via `record_endpoint(url)`.
  When you add a new outbound call site, **call `record_endpoint(url)` before
  the HTTP request** (or use the `mq_get`/`mq_post` wrappers in `mq_helpers.py`
  that do it for you). ACE side: `fetch_ace` already calls it.
- `_current_caller` — set by `BasicAuthMiddleware` after a successful Basic Auth
  check (SSE only). Populates the `caller` field in JSONL.

### CSV manifests are offline (and auto-reload on change)
`resources/qmgr_dump.csv`, `resources/node_dump.csv`, `resources/node_config.csv`,
and `resources/cert_dump.csv` are extracts produced by external jobs. Tools that
read them (`find_mq_object`, `search_ace_local_dump`, `get_cert_details`) say
"OFFLINE" in their docstring — the freshness depends on the CSV's
`extractedat`/`timestamp` columns (or the extract's run time), not on a live system.

These are replaced by a daily extract job, so the loaders **must not** cache
load-once-forever. Every `load_*` goes through `server/csv_cache.py:CsvCache`,
which `stat()`s the file on each access and reloads only when `(mtime, size)`
changed — the daily swap is picked up on the next call **with no restart**. When
adding a manifest, wrap its `_load_*_from_disk` (which returns `None` on
missing/parse-error so the cache keeps last-good) in a `CsvCache` and keep the
public `load_*()` returning `cache.get()`. Do **not** reintroduce a
`if _CACHE is None` global. `/healthz` exposes per-manifest freshness via
`csv_cache.all_status()`.

### Three HTTP clients, one shutdown path
`server/mq_helpers.py`, `server/ace_helpers.py`, and `server/splunk_helpers.py`
each expose a `get_http_client` maintaining a singleton `httpx.AsyncClient` with
their own credentials. All three are closed via `aclose_http_client` in
`mqacemcpserver/mqacemcpserver.py:_shutdown`'s finally block (and the single
build's `single_server.py:_shutdown`). Do not create ad-hoc clients in tools —
use `mq_get`/`mq_post` for MQ, `fetch_ace` for ACE, and `run_spl` for Splunk.

### Adding a new MQ tool — minimum checklist
1. Implement in `server/mq_tools.py` inside `register(mcp)`.
2. Both decorators in the right order (`@mcp.tool()` then `@logged_tool`).
3. Docstring opens with `IBM MQ:`.
4. Make HTTP calls via `mq_get` / `mq_post` (not the raw client) so the endpoint
   gets recorded.
5. Resolve hostname, then call `hostname_allowed(...)` before any HTTP call.
6. Wrap exceptions with `friendly_error` (which goes through `safe_error_message`).

### Adding a new ACE tool — minimum checklist
1. Implement in `server/ace_tools.py` inside `register(mcp)`.
2. Both decorators (same order).
3. Docstring opens with `IBM ACE:`. Tool name uses `ace_` prefix or contains `ace`.
4. Make REST calls via `fetch_ace(node, path, component, ...)` — it handles
   endpoint resolution, allow-list, recording, and error sanitisation.

### Adding a new Splunk tool — minimum checklist
1. Implement in `server/splunk_tools.py` inside `register(mcp)` (mirror it in
   both builds — the single build ships its own `server/` package).
2. Both decorators (same order). Tool name uses the `splunk_` prefix.
3. Docstring opens with `Splunk:`.
4. Run searches via `run_spl(spl, earliest, latest, max_count)` — it screens the
   SPL with `is_unsafe_spl`, applies the Splunk allow-list, records the endpoint,
   parses the ND-JSON, and routes failures through `safe_error_message`. It
   returns `(events | None, error_message | None)`; never build SPL that a user
   string could turn into a write/exfil command — `run_spl` blocks those, but
   keep user terms quoted.
5. Do NOT default a `source_type`/sourcetype filter to a guessed value —
   sourcetypes are deployment-specific; let the index scope narrow the search.

## Logging contract for Power BI

Two file-based logs in `LOG_DIR` (default `<project>/logs/`), daily-rotated:
- `app-YYYY-MM-DD.log` — plain text, mirrors stderr.
- `queries-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` — one JSON object per tool invocation. Schema in
  `mqacemcpserver/README.md` "Logging" section. Power BI ingests via "Get Data → From Folder".

Sensitive kwargs are auto-redacted: any kwarg whose lowercase name contains
`password`, `secret`, `token`, `auth`, `pwd`, `key`, or `credential` is replaced
with `"[REDACTED]"`. To opt a parameter into redaction, name it accordingly.

## Environment variables

Loaded from `.env` (repo root) by `mqacemcpserver/server/config.py` at import
time — the config auto-detects whether it's running standalone (its own
`resources/` beside the code) or in the mono-repo (shared root `resources/` and
`.env`). The full table is in `mqacemcpserver/README.md`. Namespaces operators
most often touch:
- `MQ_ALLOWED_HOSTNAME_PREFIXES` / `ACE_ALLOWED_HOSTNAME_PREFIXES` /
  `SPLUNK_ALLOWED_HOSTNAME_PREFIXES` — comma-separated hostname prefixes;
  MQ/ACE default `lod,loq,lot`, Splunk default `localhost,lod,loq,lot`.
- `SPLUNK_URL_BASE` (splunkd REST/search port, e.g. `https://localhost:8089`),
  `SPLUNK_USER` / `SPLUNK_PASSWORD`, and `SPLUNK_MQ_INDEX` / `SPLUNK_ACE_INDEX`
  (must match where the forwarder lands the MQ/ACE logs — they're
  deployment-specific, not guessable).
- `MCP_TRANSPORT` (`stdio` / `sse`), `MCP_AUTH_USER` + `MCP_AUTH_PASSWORD`
  (enables Basic Auth on SSE; `/healthz` always bypasses auth).

## Things that are deliberately NOT done

- **TLS verification is hardcoded `verify=False`** in both helpers. The user
  has explicitly opted to keep it that way for now; do not change without asking.
- **`requirements.txt` uses `>=` not `==`.** Same — explicit user choice.
- **`pytest`/`pytest-asyncio` are not in `requirements.txt`.** They live only
  in the dev `.venv`. If you change tests, document the install step.

## The `backend/` + `frontend/` chatbot stack (separate product)

`backend/` and `frontend/` together are a self-contained web chat UI + agent
backend that *uses* this MCP server over its SSE endpoint. They are **not**
part of the MCP server and the MCP server does not depend on them. Treat them
as separate products in one repo, each independently deployable (own
`requirements.txt`, own `.env`, own venv). See `backend/README.md` for full docs.

### Architecture summary
- `backend/` — FastAPI on `:8002`. LangGraph `create_react_agent`
  with `MemorySaver` (per-`thread_id` in-process). Tools loaded via
  `langchain-mcp-adapters.MultiServerMCPClient` pointed at `MCP_SSE_URL`.
- `frontend/` — **Streamlit** app (Python: `app.py`, `client.py`,
  `renderers.py`) on `:8003`. Streams from the backend over SSE via `httpx`.
  (There is no Next.js frontend in this repo despite older references; the
  Streamlit app lives directly in `frontend/`.)
- `scripts/start-all.ps1` / `start-streamlit.ps1` / `stop-all.ps1` — launchers
  that pre-flight prereqs and spawn the service windows. `start-all.ps1` brings up
  **both** MCP builds side by side — the main build (`mqacemcpserver`, :8009,
  reads root `.env`) and the single build (`mqacemcpserver-single`, :8010, reads
  its own `.env`) — plus backend :8002, Streamlit UI :8003, dashboard :8004. The
  backend defaults to the main build (:8009); the Streamlit sidebar lets a user
  switch to the single build or a custom MCP URL at runtime (see backend
  `MCP_SERVERS_JSON` and `/api/mcp/connect`). `-SkipMcp` skips both MCP builds;
  `-SkipMcpMain` / `-SkipMcpSingle` skip one. Other `-Skip*` switches isolate a
  tier. Both `start-all.ps1` and `start-streamlit.ps1` launch the Streamlit UI
  from `frontend/`.
- The dashboard process (`dashboard/dashboard_server.py`) does **not** load
  `dashboard/.env` itself — it reads `MCP_DASHBOARD_PORT` / `MCP_SERVER_DIR` /
  `MCP_DASHBOARD_SERVERS_JSON` from the process environment and gets TLS from the
  imported build's `server.config`. It renders **one tab per MCP build**: `/dashboard`
  is a tabbed wrapper, `/dashboard/<key>` is that build's full dashboard for its log
  dir. `start-all.*` injects `MCP_SERVER_DIR` (the main build, for TLS),
  `MCP_DASHBOARD_PORT`, and `MCP_DASHBOARD_SERVERS_JSON` (both builds' log dirs:
  main → `custom-logs`, single → `mqacemcpserver-single/logs`). If you launch the
  dashboard another way, set those env vars yourself or it falls back to a single
  tab from the imported `server.config` `LOG_DIR`.

### Hard rules when working in this repo
- **Do not modify any file under `mqacemcpserver/` or `resources/` from
  chatbot work.** The MCP server is untouched by design; the chatbot talks to
  it like any external client. If the chatbot needs a new behaviour, change the
  chatbot, not the server.
- **The frontend is MCP-server-agnostic.** No tool names, no MQ/ACE
  strings. All UI customisation (header title/subtitle, scope hint,
  empty-state) flows from backend `/api/health` → `frontend/client.py`
  → `frontend/app.py`.
- **The renderers (`backend/renderers.py` and the frontend's
  `frontend/renderers.py`) are tool-name-agnostic.** Use shape
  detection (JSON list keys, `key:value` lines, mermaid fences) — never
  branch on a tool name.

### Configuration knobs (all live in `backend/.env`)
| Var | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `MCP_SSE_URL` | The DEFAULT MCP server activated at startup. |
| `MCP_SERVERS_JSON` | Registry of selectable servers (`name`/`url`/`prompt_file`/`default`) shown in the sidebar dropdown. Each can map to its own prompt. Falls back to a single entry from `MCP_SSE_URL`. |
| `MCP_AUTH_USER` / `MCP_AUTH_PASSWORD` | Basic Auth for SSE (shared by all registry servers). |
| `MCP_HEADERS_JSON` | Bearer / custom headers (escape hatch). |
| `HEADER_TITLE` / `HEADER_SUBTITLE` | UI title bar; subtitle override. |
| `BOT_DOMAIN` | Scope guardrail; empty = unrestricted. |
| `SYSTEM_PROMPT_FILE` | Override prompt file path. Default is `backend/prompts/system.md`. |
| `TOOL_ALLOWLIST` / `TOOL_DENYLIST` | Filter which MCP tools the agent sees. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_MODEL` | LLM. |

### Where common changes go
- Edit the system prompt → `backend/prompts/system.md` (markdown,
  uses `{scope_block}` and `{tool_catalog}` placeholders).
- Add a new structured rendering rule → `backend/renderers.py`
  (a new detector, NOT a per-tool function).
- Add a new wire-protocol event kind / `Block` shape → `backend/schemas.py`
  AND the frontend renderer in `frontend/renderers.py` (which dispatches
  on `block.kind`).
- Change the theme → Streamlit theming via `PAGE_TITLE` / `PAGE_ICON` in
  `frontend/.env`, or a `frontend/.streamlit/config.toml`
  `[theme]` block. (The old Tailwind `tailwind.config.ts` / `app/globals.css`
  no longer exist.)
